Remake / revamp of https://github.com/sandsq/AdvancedLayoutCalculator.jl

Code is a combination of "this is basically what I did in julia" + "hey this rust feature looks cool let's try it out" + "I have no clue what I'm doing".

(incomplete)
- The optimization is focused on typing and can't account for navigation, shortcuts, etc.; there isn't really data for those anyway.
- I still recommend putting navigation, shortcuts, etc. where you want them in the initial layout and marking those keys as not moveable. This way, you can see where your navigation, shortcuts, etc. are in the resulting layout.
